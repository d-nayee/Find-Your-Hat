# Find-Your-Hat
A project on Codecademy for the Back-End Engineer path. 


The project is to create a game using JavaScript. The aim of the game is:

For the player '*' to find their hat '^'\
In a 2 dimensional field '░'\
Which has holes 'O'.

For example:

      *░░░░░
      ░░░O░░
      O░░O░░
      ░O░░░^
      
Each time they move their path will be mapped by an *. For example:

      ******
      ░░░O░*
      O░░O░*
      ░░O░░^
      
The player must not go out side of the field and they must also not land in a hole.

They will use the following commands to move:

**U** for moving up\
**D** for moving down\
**L** for moving left\
**R** for moving Right
